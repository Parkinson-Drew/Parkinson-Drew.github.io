            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Personas are created to reflect a specific user based on available data and user interviews. Though the
                personal details of the persona may be fiction, the information used to create the user type is not.</p>
            <p>This section requires some research about the website visitors by looking into the purpose and the
                industry, visiting similar sites and preforming surveys to discover what scenarios are relevant to the
                visitor. Develop two personas (Links to an external site.) to describe the target audience for the
                weather site. This section should describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of
                the most plausible demographics.</p>

            <p>Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and
                family status. Additional audience information would include where, when and how the visitor will be
                accessing the site. What device will they be using?</p>
            <p>Demographics: The common variables that are gathered in demographic research include age, sex, income
                level, race, employment, location, homeownership, and level of education.</p>
